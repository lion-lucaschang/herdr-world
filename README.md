Herdr World is a browser and mobile workspace for [Herdr](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr).
It combines live terminal Spaces with visual Pixel Office and Graph themes, multi-host viewing,
shared navigation, mobile controls, notes, uploads, and agent-aware workflows.

The current public preview is
[`v0.1.1`](https://github.com/IvoryHeart/herdr-world/releases/tag/v0.1.1).
It supports Linux x86-64 and macOS on Apple Silicon and Intel, and requires Herdr `v0.9.0` or newer
with terminal protocol `22`. Visit the [project site](https://ivoryheart.github.io/herdr-world/) for
an interactive overview.

## Quick Start

Start or attach to a Herdr session, then choose an installation method. npm and the Herdr plugin
require Node.js `22.14.0` or newer.

### npm

```bash
npm install --global @ivoryheart/herdr-world@latest
herdr-world
```

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install IvoryHeart/tap/herdr-world
herdr-world
```

### Herdr plugin

```bash
herdr plugin install IvoryHeart/herdr-world --ref v0.1.1
herdr plugin action invoke open --plugin ivoryheart.herdr-world
```

### Lucas fork preview

This fork carries Herdr `0.9.0` / terminal protocol `22` compatibility and browser-local
character customization. On machines already running Herdr `0.9.0`, install the pinned fork tag with:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lion-lucaschang/herdr-world/v0.1.1-lucas.2/scripts/install-lucas-fork.sh | bash
```

Manual install or upgrade from a previous Herdr World plugin:

```bash
herdr plugin action invoke stop --plugin ivoryheart.herdr-world || true
herdr plugin uninstall ivoryheart.herdr-world || true
herdr plugin install lion-lucaschang/herdr-world --ref v0.1.1-lucas.2 --yes
herdr plugin action invoke start --plugin ivoryheart.herdr-world
```

The fork build requires Node.js `22.14.0` or newer and Rust `1.88.0` or newer because the plugin
builds the native bridge from source.

Open [http://127.0.0.1:8787](http://127.0.0.1:8787) if the browser does not open automatically.
Checksum-verified standalone archives are available on the
[release page](https://github.com/IvoryHeart/herdr-world/releases/tag/v0.1.1).

The macOS binaries are not yet signed or notarized. After verifying the download, the first launch
may need approval in **System Settings → Privacy & Security**.

## Advanced Usage

Select a session, socket, or alternate port with normal launcher options:

```bash
herdr-world --session NAME
HERDR_SOCKET_PATH=/path/to/herdr.sock herdr-world --port 8791
herdr-world --no-herdr-setup
```

The interactive launcher can offer to install, update, or start Herdr. It asks before each action;
`--no-herdr-setup` disables those prompts.

Agent harnesses running inside a Herdr pane can publish a short, expiring task summary for the
Office without starting another bridge:

```bash
herdr-world task-summary "Reviewing release checks"
herdr-world task-summary --clear
```

The command uses `HERDR_PANE_ID`, binds reports to the pane's active agent session, defaults to a
15-minute TTL, and accepts `--ttl-ms`, `--pane`, and `--session` for explicit bounded targets. It
normalizes whitespace, caps summaries at 160 Unicode characters, and redacts obvious
credential-shaped values. See the [development guide](docs/development.md#reporting-agent-task-summaries)
for the full contract.

Useful plugin operations include:

```bash
herdr plugin action invoke status --plugin ivoryheart.herdr-world
herdr plugin action invoke doctor --plugin ivoryheart.herdr-world
herdr plugin action invoke restart --plugin ivoryheart.herdr-world
herdr plugin log list --plugin ivoryheart.herdr-world --limit 20
```

Plugin actions are asynchronous and target-scoped. Before uninstalling, repeat the stop-and-status
sequence for every Herdr target or named session and wait for each action log to report
`status: succeeded`:

```bash
herdr plugin action invoke stop --plugin ivoryheart.herdr-world
herdr plugin action invoke status --plugin ivoryheart.herdr-world
herdr --session NAME plugin action invoke stop --plugin ivoryheart.herdr-world
herdr --session NAME plugin action invoke status --plugin ivoryheart.herdr-world
herdr plugin uninstall ivoryheart.herdr-world
```

Use Settings → Network → Connections to connect Herdr World to another Herdr. Adding a connection
normally needs only its address; Herdr World asks for a password when the other Herdr requires one.
Use Network → Allow connections to let Herdr World elsewhere connect to this Herdr. The basic flow
provides an on/off control, a copyable address, and optional password protection. Exact host, page,
and destination restrictions remain available under Advanced network permissions. Development or
standalone launches show these settings as read-only when no controller-owned restart boundary is
available. Direct connections are intended for a trusted LAN/VPN path; use TLS, a VPN, or SSH for
untrusted networks.

To run from source:

```bash
npm install
npm install --prefix web
npm run dev:local
```

The full application is served at [http://127.0.0.1:8787](http://127.0.0.1:8787). Run
`npm run check` before submitting changes.

Binding the bridge beyond loopback is security-sensitive and requires explicit host and origin
allow-lists. Use a VPN, SSH tunnel, or authenticated reverse proxy for remote access. See the
[development](docs/development.md), [federation](docs/federation.md), [Android](docs/android.md), and
[packaging](docs/packaging.md) guides for detailed workflows.
