# Release Process

`herdr-world` is a public downstream application. One tagged release workflow assembles the
GitHub, npm, and Homebrew distributions from the same verified native artifacts. Root and web
development manifests remain private at version `0.0.0`; public package versions are derived from
the release tag.

## Prerequisites

- Clean `main` branch.
- Node.js 22 or newer.
- npm, with Node.js `22.14.0` or newer required for Herdr plugin payload installation and runtime.
- Rust stable.
- `cargo-about` 0.9.2 (`cargo install cargo-about --version 0.9.2 --locked --features cli`).
- JDK 21 and Android SDK when validating the Android shell.
- GitHub CLI authenticated as a user that can create releases.
- Active repository rulesets protecting `main` and `v*` release tags.
- The public `IvoryHeart/homebrew-tap` repository and an Actions secret named
  `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN`, restricted to that repository's Formula contents.
- After the one-time npm bootstrap: the exact `.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow configured
  as the npm trusted publisher for `@ivoryheart/herdr-world`.
- `origin` fetch and push URLs both resolve to `IvoryHeart/herdr-world`. The release helper rejects
  upstream, fork, local-path, and unsupported remote URLs before making any release mutation.
- A local Herdr `v0.9.0` or newer session reporting terminal protocol `22` for browser and packaged
  bridge smoke testing.

## Prepare And Review

1. Confirm the changelog has user-facing notes under `## [Unreleased]`.
   Entries merged through pull requests should include the PR number or link before the PR is
   merged.
2. Confirm the vendored Herdr compatibility crate is intentional and clean:

```bash
scripts/check-vendor.sh
```

3. Run the full automated check:

```bash
npm run check
```

4. Create a clean release branch from the current remote `main`:

```bash
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git switch -c release/v0.1.0
```

5. Generate the complete release diff without committing, tagging, or pushing:

```bash
node scripts/release.mjs prepare v0.1.0
```

The preparation command requires the branch to start exactly at `origin/main`, repeats the normal
repository check, updates every release reference, promotes the changelog notes, removes empty
released subsections, records the exact Herdr Web baseline from `UPSTREAM.md`, and opens the next
empty `## [Unreleased]` section in the same diff. The World changelog contains World releases and
downstream changes; it links the baseline instead of copying Herdr Web's release history.

The generated changelog date is the intended UTC release date. Merge, preflight, and tag on that
date. If review delays the release past it, update the date in the release PR and have that revision
reviewed. The tag command rejects a stale date instead of publishing inaccurate release notes.

6. Inspect the diff, commit it with the exact subject `Release v0.1.0`, push the branch, and open a
pull request with that exact title. Do not merge until independent review is complete. The squash
merge subject will become `Release v0.1.0 (#<number>)`, which is the release provenance recorded by
the tag.

Do not cut a release without bridge test/build coverage.

Corrections use a new release-candidate number. For example, a correction after
`v1.2.3-rc.2` is `v1.2.3-rc.3`; the existing tag and public package content are never replaced.

## Package Artifacts

Desktop artifacts are built from the final tag by `.github/workflows/release.yml`; do not upload a
locally built substitute. The explicit distribution preflight runs the same Linux, Apple-Silicon,
and Intel artifact, Formula, and plugin lifecycle matrix without publishing; ordinary pull requests
rely on the normal CI workflow, including its release unit tests. Each native job checks the CPU
format and bundle contents, then exercises the packaged bridge against two checksum-pinned stock
Herdr v0.9.0 daemons. One required notice gate validates the complete cross-platform dependency
closure before any native job starts, avoiding three redundant builds of the notice generator.

## Herdr Plugin Release

The plugin is released with the application tag but does not publish a second application artifact.
Before any public channel is changed, the workflow installs the exact generated npm tarball into an
isolated checkout and runs the plugin lifecycle smoke on all three supported targets: Linux
x86-64/glibc 2.34+, macOS ARM64, and macOS x86-64. The smoke uses a checksum-pinned stock Herdr
v0.9.0 daemon and checks the plugin build, action listing, startup restoration, first/repeated start,
status, open, doctor, restart, browser readiness, a second session/port, and
stop-before-uninstall. The explicit preflight and tagged workflow use the same unpublished-package
path, so a failure prevents the GitHub release, npm channel, and Homebrew Formula from advancing.

Install the plugin from the default branch or pin a release:

```bash
herdr plugin install IvoryHeart/herdr-world
herdr plugin install IvoryHeart/herdr-world --ref vX.Y.Z
```

Installation registers and builds the plugin but does not invoke its runtime actions. The plugin's
Herdr startup hook starts the bridge on the next server restore; use
`herdr plugin action invoke open --plugin ivoryheart.herdr-world` to start and open it immediately
for an already-running server. Plugin installation requires Node.js `22.14.0` or newer and npm. Rust and Cargo are not required;
the build installs the exact prebuilt npm payload with lifecycle scripts disabled. Global npm and
Homebrew installations are ignored. Local `herdr plugin link` skips the build command, so run the
exact payload install command printed by `bash scripts/herdr-world-plugin.sh build` before invoking
actions. Herdr records startup-hook failures without stopping its server. Reinstalling the GitHub
plugin is the refresh mechanism; config and state remain in Herdr's per-user plugin directories.
Add the `herdr-plugin` GitHub topic only after the tagged install and three-platform smoke pass.

Linux desktop tarball:

```bash
npm ci
npm ci --prefix web
scripts/package-tarball.sh vX.Y.Z linux-x86_64
```

macOS ARM desktop tarball, run on an Apple Silicon Mac:

```bash
npm ci
npm ci --prefix web
scripts/package-tarball.sh vX.Y.Z macos-arm64
```

macOS Intel desktop tarball, run on an Intel Mac:

```bash
npm ci
npm ci --prefix web
scripts/package-tarball.sh vX.Y.Z macos-x86_64
```

Android debug APK:

```bash
npm ci
npm ci --prefix web
npm run android:build:debug
```

Local desktop tarballs are written to `dist-packages/`. The debug APK is written to
`android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

Before uploading or distributing any tarball or APK, inspect the artifact and confirm it matches the
documented release layout, platform, version, and source commit/tag. For desktop tarballs, list the
archive contents and verify the root installer, named installer, version marker, wrapper, bridge
binary, bundled `web/dist`, README, root license,
third-party notices, upstream record, Apache/PixiJS license texts, generated production npm/Cargo
licence inventories, World asset record, and Herdr vendor manifest are present.
For APKs, inspect the package listing or metadata and verify the bundled
`public/legal/manifest.json` and every file it names.

The macOS archives are intentionally unsigned and unnotarized. Developer ID signing and
notarization are deferred for the first stable `v0.1.0` release and can be revisited when project
credentials are available. Release notes and user documentation must retain that limitation. The
workflow does not attempt to weaken Gatekeeper or modify a user's security policy.

For the desktop installer, verify `./install --install-only` creates versioned user-local files and
working `herdr-world`/`herdr-world-installer` command links without starting Herdr. Verify the
normal `./install` path hands off to the installed launcher. For the desktop launcher, verify
`bin/herdr-world --help` never starts onboarding, a
non-interactive launch with no default Herdr socket fails with manual instructions, and an
interactive missing-session launch asks independently before installation and startup. Also verify
that an interactive incompatible default server asks independently before installation/update,
server stop, and restart, while declining the stop leaves it running. A stale socket with no
reachable daemon must proceed to startup without a stop prompt. Do not exercise the live
installer during release verification; the launcher tests replace its network and process
boundaries with deterministic fakes.

To stage the current debug APK under the release asset name for private testing:

```bash
mkdir -p dist-packages
cp android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk dist-packages/herdr-world-vX.Y.Z-android-debug.apk
```

For a public release, build a signed release APK instead and use the non-debug release asset name:

```text
dist-packages/herdr-world-vX.Y.Z-android.apk
```

## Browser And Federation Smoke

Start or attach a Herdr `v0.9.0` or newer session reporting terminal protocol `22`:

```bash
herdr
```

Build and run the web bridge:

```bash
npm run build
scripts/run-bridge.sh
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8787` and verify:

- The app loads the workspace, tab, pane, and split layout snapshot.
- Multiple browser clients can attach to the same terminal.
- Pane selection syncs between browser clients.
- Typing, mobile text input, stage-only input, tap-focus setting, scrolling, and refit work.
- Desktop IME composition commits once and canceled preedit is not replayed; dialog/menu focus
  returns to the invoking control.
- Settings → Terminal → Screen-reader text is off by default; when enabled, its mirror contains
  only a bounded visible terminal viewport, including visible scrolled-back rows, and does not
  expose unbounded terminal history or hidden cells.
- New tabs can launch Shell and every enabled managed built-in agent.
- Split right/down can launch Shell and every enabled managed built-in agent.
- A custom preset launches its exact configured `argv`, including a wrapper or SSH-shaped command,
  without a built-in agent executable being prepended.
- A forced managed-agent launch failure removes the tab or split created for that launch.
- Upload button, paste upload, and drop upload place shell-quoted file paths in the terminal.
- Pane notes can be created, edited, reloaded, and recovered from the Notes view.
- Binding to `HOST=0.0.0.0` is only used on a trusted network.

Then follow the two-host procedure in [federation.md](federation.md) and verify direct browser
connections to both bridges, collision-safe host-qualified navigation and command routing, isolated
offline/incompatible host states, terminal input and resize, and serving-host reload behavior. Run
the automated acceptance gate from a clean dependency install:

```bash
npm run check:acceptance
```

Repeat the startup, terminal attach, and launcher checks with an unpacked desktop tarball before
uploading it. Confirm the bridge rejects every protocol other than `22`
instead of serving a partially compatible UI.

## Cut

After the reviewed release PR merges, use a clean origin-only release checkout. This avoids a
same-named tag fetched from the Herdr Web upstream being mistaken for a Herdr World tag. Synchronize
exact `main`, then explicitly start the complete distribution preflight:

```bash
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
gh workflow run release.yml --ref main
```

Wait for the `Release distribution` run to pass. The preflight builds synthetic native, npm, and
Homebrew artifacts; exercises the exact unpublished plugin and Formula on Linux x86-64, macOS
ARM64, and macOS x86-64; and cannot publish. The tag command rejects a preflight from any other
commit.

After the exact preflight and the browser/federation smoke above pass, create the release tag:

```bash
node scripts/release.mjs tag v0.1.0
```

The tag command:

- requires a clean `main` branch
- verifies both `origin` URLs and GitHub CLI access against `IvoryHeart/herdr-world`
- verifies that `main` is the reviewed `Release v0.1.0 (#<number>)` squash merge
- verifies that the changelog release date is the current UTC date
- verifies the exact successful distribution preflight
- runs `npm run check`
- rechecks the stamped release, changelog, plugin manifest, and public references
- rejects an existing local or public tag, release, npm version, or conflicting Homebrew version
- pushes only the immutable `v0.1.0` tag at the exact verified commit

It never commits or pushes `main`. If the release checkout already contains an unrelated upstream
`v0.1.0` tag, stop and use a clean origin-only clone rather than moving or deleting that upstream
identity.

The tag starts the release distribution workflow. It builds and verifies Linux x86-64, macOS ARM64,
and macOS x86-64 archives, npm package, plugin lifecycle, and Homebrew Formula before assembling the
GitHub release or advancing a public package channel. It then publishes the enabled GitHub, npm, and
Homebrew channels from those exact tested outputs. The release commit's site changes also trigger
the Pages deployment. No separate desktop upload or documentation-edit step is required.

## Android Validation

Before distributing Android builds, follow [docs/android.md](android.md): run
`npm run android:build:debug`, and smoke test bridge configuration on a device or emulator with a
bridge started using `--allow-origin http://localhost`. Revisit the Android backup policy before
adding any pairing token or other secret storage.

## One-time npm bootstrap and external setup

The first npm publication must be a release candidate. The protected workflow generates and
install-tests the exact package tarball, then reports it as an action-required artifact because npm
trusted publishing cannot be configured until the package exists.

1. Download `npm-package-${RUN_ID}` from the tagged workflow.
2. Verify its SHA-256 and npm integrity against `npm-package-metadata.json`.
3. Publish that exact `.tgz` unchanged with interactive 2FA and the `next` dist-tag:

```bash
npm publish herdr-world-vX.Y.Z-rc.N.tgz --access public --tag next
```

4. In npm package settings, configure GitHub Actions trusted publishing for user `IvoryHeart`,
   repository `herdr-world`, workflow `.github/workflows/release.yml`, allowing `npm publish`.
5. Verify the registry version and integrity, then enable two-factor authentication for writes and
   disallow traditional publishing tokens. Later tagged releases publish through OIDC and require
   no `NPM_TOKEN`.

npm scans newly published packages before making them publicly installable. Initial verification
may return not found for several minutes even after `npm publish` succeeds; do not republish the
immutable version. The protected workflow waits up to 20 minutes for public availability before
verifying the exact integrity and channel pointer, and an idempotent rerun can finish validation if
the scan takes longer.

Create the tap-scoped fine-grained GitHub token manually and save it as the repository Actions secret
`HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN`. It needs only Contents read/write access to `IvoryHeart/homebrew-tap`; it must
not be written to a Formula, artifact, cache, or log. The workflow validates and exercises the
Formula on all three supported native runners before committing directly to the tap's default branch.

After the tag is pushed, monitor `Release distribution` and `Deploy GitHub Pages`. The release
workflow reports GitHub, npm, and Homebrew results separately. It does not publish Android debug
builds or unsigned artifacts as production-signed software.

## After

- Confirm the GitHub release exists and points at the expected tag.
- Confirm release assets and checksum files are attached.
- Confirm both macOS archives are still described as unsigned until signing is implemented.
- Confirm the project site links to the new release after the Pages deployment.
- Confirm `CHANGELOG.md` on `main` has a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` section.
